# Getting Started with Home Library

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run dev-server`

Creates server and lets you see any changes made live in the browser
Typically opens at http://localhost:8080  
To see changes to css you will need to open another terminal or CLI and run `npm run build-tailwindcss`

### `npm run build-tailwindcss`

This rebuilds and updates `output.css` in the `/public` folder as you make changes to the css

# Notes

This app was inspired by my wife.  She loves to read and has a huge collection of books.  When she goes to purchase a new book she'll sometimes struggle to remember if she already has a copy or not.  This was made to help remind her of what books she has and also add a fun way to organize her collection.  It also keeps track of what books she's looking to purchase (wishlist) so when she goes to the store she remembers what book she wanted the prior week.  No more missed books!
